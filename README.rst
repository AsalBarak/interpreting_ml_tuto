Understanding and diagnosing your machine-learning models
===================================================================

Achieving a good prediction is often only half of the job. Questions
immediately arise: How to improve this prediction? What drives the
prediction? Can we operate changes to the system based on the
predictions? All these questions require understanding how good is the
model prediction, and how do the model predict.

This tutorial assumes basic knowledge of scikit-learn. It will focus on
statistics, tests, and interpretation rather than improving the
prediction.
